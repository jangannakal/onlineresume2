            <h3>An Advanced TCM Practitioner Reading List</h3>
            <p> My TCM library is a sort of refuge for me. A place I retreat to when I can, although not as often as I would like. There remains
                a desire to commit myself completely to its study, outside the distractions and demands of everyday life. And yet, it is these 
                demands and distractions which, out of necessity for solution, lead me back to the books:</p>
                <ul class="about">
                    <li>My baby son has indigestion with constipation.</li>
                    <li>My grandmother-in-law falls ill with vertigo and vomiting.</li>
                    <li>A friend of a friend has a wound that will not heal.</li>
                    <li>What is the thermal nature of douchi?</li>
                </ul> 
                
             <p>The 10,000 things require review of the theoretical 
                frameworks which regulate them so they might be solved.</p>
                <p> So, here is a list of indispensible sources which better serve the practitioner who has already done the work building
                strong TCM theoretical foundations. It is not complete by any means but serves as a starting point to drill deeper as wanted or needed. </p>

            <p>As if TCM study is not challenging enough, I introduce Manfred Porkert to the mix. 
                    His prose is robust and unmerciful
                    but the revealed insights make the literary beatdown well worth it.</p>
