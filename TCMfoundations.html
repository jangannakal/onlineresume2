            <h3>A TCM reading list for aspiring practitioners.</h3>
            <p>Traditional Chinese Medicine is a qualitative science born out of the observational lens of Taoism and refined by the brutalism of Mao&#39s cultural revolution. 
                Its scope of value is needlessly minimized in the west and what remains is lauded by its beneficiaries and dismissed by its critics. Nevertheless, I remain optimistic that 
                TCM will continue its slow march towards broader acceptance and, more importantly&#44 broader implementation across western society.  
            </p>
            <p><span class="span">TCM is not easy to learn.</span> And western students suffer from various absenses in their learning process. Among these deficiences can be 
                counted the irregular educational standards set by schools&#44 no formalised apprenticeship system for new graduates&#44 and the 
                cultural gap between China and the English speaking west rendering fundamental concepts inadequately translated and thus, diluted of meaning.  
                  A simple test of any student&#39s knowledge is to ask for a definition of qi. The answer of energy is a failing grade. 
            </p>   
            <p>So, I submit this reading list for aspirants, students and curious readers alike. Once these texts are known inside out, one can  
                tentatively, and under good guidance, endevour to treat the 10,000 things. Good luck!
