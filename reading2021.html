            <h3>Personal Reading List 2021</h3>
            <p>Here's my reading list from 2021. By no means exhaustive, it captures the main standouts of 2021. 
                I tend to switch between multiple texts at any one time. A constant re-reader of books and their specific chapters or paragraphs or
                lines; it slow burns my little grey cells in just the right way. </p>

            <p>Part of the equities and options reading I undertook in the beginning of the year, 
                this book charts the most powerful and successful going concern 
                in the world. Still working my way through it.

            <p>Mad history from a different era and a world almost unrecognizable today. 
                I'm endlessly fascinated by the travelling monk meta, and even more so
                from the time long before motor vehicles and modernity.

            <p>Little of Javanese and Sumatran buddhist history is available in english. 
                Finding this book, while researching East Javanese jamu origins, was a stroke of luck. 
                Having visited some of the temples and areas listed in the book, Reichle provided the necessary depth my experential travels lacked.

            <p>I would not recommend this book but it has its merits. While the author's definition of qi falls far short of the mark and sets 
                the tone for a remedial discussion of therapeutics, snippets of insight and wisdom can be found if willing to endure.

            <p>Ever since my 2019 trip to Egypt, I have been endlessly fascinated by the competing historical narratives 
                of this incredible place. Bauval 
                plays an important role as explorer and disruptor in this continually evolving conversation around ancient Egypt. Dismayed to learn the 
                Nabta Playa stones were relocated from their original location to the Aswan Nubia museum.

            <p>I constantly search for the recipes that informed my eating experiences while living and travelling in SE Asia. This book does not disappoint. 
                Regional dishes across India, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. It elevated my curry game and I've never looked back. Buy immediately.

                <p> Being a qualitative science, Traditional Chinese Medicine relies on observational descriptions to capture the essense of a symptom or disease state. 
                    Prepare to go deep between the lines of term etymology as pinyin, chinese characters and english translations are examined in referenced discussion. Not a beginner text.

        <p>Loved this book as the standard narrative of Hitler's desmise in a Berlin bunker never met any evidentiary basis that would survive scrutiny in a court of law. 
            Had stumbled upon a similar book some twenty years ago at university. Great to read about some of the locations I have 
            since visited that played a role in the final days of the fleeing Nazi criminal class. Casa Winters in Fuerteventura, for example.

            <p>As a serial entrepreneur with a solid failure rate, I have found studying the 
                PMP exam prep books helpful in keeping me in my lane and ensuring my
                organizational workflow is conforming with recognized standards. Reduce complexity, eliminate churn and proceed flexibly step-by-step. 
                A great guide for attaining these goals.

            <p>The writings of Benjamin Graham, patron saint of deep value investing, leave me pining for that golden era of investment. 
                Hunting value equities in the overheated bull market has been a fun. 
                Some savants manage it profitably - I have not. This was a gateway book to tackling the CFA curriculum.

            <p>Came to this book for its discussion on Jamu, the traditional medicine system indigenous to Indonesia. Was not disappointed. Unknown to 
                me was the role Indonesia played as intersectional middle man between India and China during the Buddhist/Hindu heyday. The ramifications of which 
                played no small part in the development of these societies and religions.

            <p>Hunting for clues to use the golden ratio in designing a property layout in Indonesia, I came across what is essentially the finest 
                adult coloring book one could wish for. Asked Araujo directly for help on my project. He declined, saying it sounded like a lot of work.

            <p>Schwaller's intellectual prowess is next level. I attempt to absorb these chapters with little success but much enjoyment. He is the 
                Manfred Porkert of the Egyptologist crowd. Insightful and beautiful prose.

            <p>Entertaining read from Vaughters. Was able to contrast his public personality versus the backroom Vaughters I have known: a neo-liberal capitalist leveraging virtue and ethics as marketing assets to promote his for-profit brand. 
                He carved out a niche in European pro biking, toppled Armstrong and perhaps came to accept competitive cycling for the fundamentally broken entity it is. Which makes it great entertainment. I repeat: Entertainment.

            <p>Robert Kennedy Jr. is a great human being. The import of this book went unrealized 
                by me until I read its publisher is owned by Simon and Schuster; meaning every claim 
                has been verified by a team of legal experts paid huge money to avoid costly defamation lawsuits. In short, the facts are verified. The emperor wears no clothes. </p>

            <p>A Balinese contact took me to Sidemen in 2017 where we toured a Batik production
                 company housed in an old chicken farm. I had no idea what Batik was. A few years later, at a pan-Indonesian Batik event held at the Solo Palace in Java, 
                 I 
                bought as many peices as I could fit into my backpack. Later, my wife and I visited every Batik producer we could find in the Yogyakarta area. 
                Time goes on crutches until I can visit the East Java production houses. This book captures the essence of Batik.

            <p>Engaging and detailed sneak peak into the world of elBulli, a restaurant I stumbled upon 
                in 2009 while working the Tour of Catalonia. Didn't manage to get a table that day. Ferran's process
